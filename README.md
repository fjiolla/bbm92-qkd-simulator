# BBM92 Quantum Key Distribution Simulator 🔐⚛️

This project implements the BBM92 quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol using Python and Qiskit. It simulates secure entanglement-based communication for satellite-to-ship scenarios in a free-space quantum channel, modeling realistic factors such as atmospheric loss, noise, and eavesdropping.

> Developed as part of a research initiative on quantum satellite-vehicular communication.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ BBM92 protocol with entangled qubit generation and basis reconciliation
- ✅ Atmospheric loss modeling using Beer-Lambert law
- ✅ Eavesdropper (Eve) simulation with basis mismatch and interception
- ✅ QBER (Quantum Bit Error Rate), SKR (Secret Key Rate), and throughput calculation
- ✅ SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) analysis
- ✅ Comparative visualizations between **BBM92** and **MDI-QKD** (optional)
- ✅ Graphs: `QBER vs Distance`, `SKR vs Distance`, and more
- ✅ Realistic noise simulation using `qiskit_aer.noise`

## 🧠 What is BBM92?

The BBM92 protocol uses entangled photon pairs for secure key exchange. It is an entanglement-based variant of BB84 and is resilient against photon-number-splitting attacks.
